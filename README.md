# Data-Mining-Course-Activities
The main assignments for the Data Mining course offered at the University of Tehran

**First assignment:** Basic Classification and Plots: Given the variable name,
 variable type, the measurement unit, and a brief description, the "Blood Transfusion Service Center"
 is a classification problem solved in this assignment using Pandas, Seaborn, and MatPlotLib libraries.

 **Second assignment:**Classification Algorithms, PCA, and Parameter Tuning: Part one is a classification problem on the Maternal Health Risk Dataset, 
using Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Support Vector Machine(SVM), and Random Forest classification algorithms.
 Parameter tuning is performed using cross-validation.

Part two is a classification problem on the Parkinson's Disease Classification Dataset, using the Decision Tree,
 K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Support Vector Machine(SVM), and Random Forest classification algorithms. Feature extraction is performed using PCA.
 I used Pandas, Numpy, Sikit-Learn, Seaborn, and MatPlotLib libraries in this assignment.

 **Third assignment:** MLP and Clustering Algorithms: Part one is a classification problem on the Labeled Faces in the Wild Face Recognition
 Dataset, using multilayer perceptrons classification algorithm. Parameter tuning is performed using grid search and PCA is used for dimensionality reduction.

Part two is a clustering problem on a dataset of points on a 2D plane, using Lloyd's k-means, Fuzzy C-means,
 and DBSCAN clustering algorithms. The Elbow method is used to find the optimal number of clusters.
I mainly used the previous libraries.
